    <h2>Joelecr's all time favorite</h2>
    <p>This is an Italian-style pasta sauce with homemade meatballs that's cooked slowly over low heat for an intense
        tomato flavor. It's easy to make the spaghetti sauce ahead of time; gently reheat and add meatballs 30 minutes
        before you're ready to serve with your favorite pasta.</p>
